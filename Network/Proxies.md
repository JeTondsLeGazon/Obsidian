## Proxychain

Possible to go through a proxy chain to hide yourserlf with the `proxychains` command.
This will look into the specific proxy chain file (check google) and use these.
Possible to configure with Tor, but should be started first

# Tor

Multitude of nodes connected to form a chain. Can be used to hide yourself but beware: if you control input/output nodes, you can control the traffic !! Meaning that if government agencies control them, not really safe.
