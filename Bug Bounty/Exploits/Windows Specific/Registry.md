The windows registry is a collection of databases for all windows infromation (users, services, hardware, etc).  ~Like the DNA of the computer

Can be accessed via `regedit

The registry possesses five main branches called `hives`:
- **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** — keeps track of default file associations. This is how your computer knows to open a Word (doc) file.
    
- **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** — contains settings specific to your username in Windows.
    
- **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** — contains passwords, boot files, software installation files, and security settings. This hive is abbreviated as HKLM and is the most critical hive.
    
- **HKEY_USERS** — like the CURRENT_USER hive, except it’s for when more than one user is logged onto the server or computer.
    
- **HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG** — a real-time measurement of different hardware activities. Information in this hive isn’t saved permanently to the registry.
