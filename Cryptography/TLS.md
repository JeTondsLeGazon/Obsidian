Could be considered an enhancement version of SSL

Used for **HTTPS** connections

### Versions
- 1
- 2
- 3: less/no compression to avoid related flaws/attacks


### Encryption

.pem files: privacy-enhanced mail (originally for mails), contains keys


### How does it work

Secured server/website will have certificate to prove it is secured. Certificate is generated by CA (Certificate Authority), which should be on your list of CA trust list to be accepted.

SSL certificate contains information about which encryption to use and more, all these data are available publicly and exchanged upon first connection.

Steps:
- The first round of exchanged will be to share information and decide how to pursue
- Then asymmetric keys to be able to exchange symmetric keys, which is much faster/simpler but less safe
- Use of symmetric keys to communicate
