The goal is to collect as much info on the target as possible: hosts (IP), usernames, technologies in place, infrastructure, ...

### Checklist
- IP Space: ASN, cloud presence, DNS entries, etc
- Domain info: who is the domain admin?, subdomains, publicly accessible servers (mail, VPN, ...), defences in place
- schema format: username/password policies (from mail for example)
- data disclosure
- breach data

### On target network

- wireshark and tcpdump: goal is to check which IP are available and which protocols they are using (maybe LLNMR)
- ARP ping
- Responder in passive mode `-I`
- fping

### Outside
- nslookup (don't forget to use `type=TXT` for potential extra info)
- google dorks
