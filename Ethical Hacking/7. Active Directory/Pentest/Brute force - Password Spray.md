## Password spraying
A very nice method of gaining access / elevate privileges on AD is to use password spraying: use one password against multiple users.

Often better than brute force as this should result in less lockouts but always wait (couple of hours) between rounds to be sure no account is blocked. The best is to have the domain password policy and check how long to wait and how many attempts we have. Always take a security margin as users may have invalid password themselves.

### Collect list of usernames
The list of users can be acquired through different methods if not on target network: 
- Social engineering / OSINT
- RID-brute on SMB
- SMB NULL session
- LDAP anonymous bind
- linkedin2username
- Likely usernames through [statistically usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)

If we have some credentials, we can:
- Query AD directly
- enum4linux
- rpcclient + `enumdomusers`
- crackmapexec (CME)
### Password
Check extremely common passwords.
Can be refined (length, complexity, ...) if we have the domain password policy

## Brute force

If we have no choice, we might still go for the brute force, ideally with `kerbrute`
