## Useful commands for PE enumeration

- `sudo -l` to check what we can run as root/another user
- `id` to check our groups
- `find / -group <group> 2>/dev/null` to find all files belonging to a group (user `2>/dev/null` always if possible)
- `find / -user <user>`
- `find / -perm -4000 -type f` to find all SUID files
- `ps -aux` to find all processes
- `ss -tulpn` to find TCP(`-t`) and UDP (`-u`) listening (`-l`)  sockets. `-n` to show port number instead of the resolved name (without it, port `80` would be shown as `http`)
- `printenv`
- `echo $PATH`
- `find /<some-path> -type f -readable` for all flies readable by current user
