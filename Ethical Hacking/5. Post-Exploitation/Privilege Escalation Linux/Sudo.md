All sudoers are written in the file /etc/sudoers in the format:
`(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump`


Two good practicies when writing in this file:
- Always specify full path of binary, otherwise PATH abuse
- Least privilege principle

## Group privileges

A user being a member of the following groups can lead to PE:
- lxc & docker: can mount filesystem
- ADM: can read all logs in /var/logs

You can find all files with group access using `find -group <group-name>`
