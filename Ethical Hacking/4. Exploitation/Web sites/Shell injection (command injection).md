Let's take a simple URL: `https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29`
There, the product ID will be queried by the system, but it may be possible it will be queries with a shell command: `stockreport.pl 381 29` 
If this is the case, then command injection is possible, by for example replacing 29 by `& echo asdf &`


| Purpose  | Linux  | Windows  |
|---|---|---|
| **Name of current user**  | whoami  | whoami  |
| **Operating system**  | uname -a  |  ver |
|  **Network configuration** | ifconfig  | ipconfig /all  |
| Network connections | netstat -an | netstat -an |
|Running processes|ps -ef|tasklist|

TIPS:
- In some url parameters, try to add separators like:
	- ; ... ;
	- & .. &
	- || ... ||
Because you may have a command after your injection (if you don't close, you may have an error, indicating a potential injection is possible!!)

## Character to try to test for vulnerability
At the end of a parameter, try these different elements to test for command injection:
- &
- ;
- |
- ||
- Newline (0x0a or \\n)
- &&
If no error message, you can try to inject your command after these characters

Most of the time, the command injection is blind, meaning you have to test for some delays
Insert above characters before and **AFTER** the command to make it work

## NSlookup
	You can mount a little web server (nc or python) and try to pink it with a nslookup command.
