## Packers and binders
Binders will append two EXE files together to create a new one, which can make AV evasion: check available one on the NET
Packers will do the same but after compressing the malware part, making it even more difficult to detect

## Code obfuscation
Changes the code to make it harder to be detected. Example: you create a python file calling CLI directly for command injection -> flagged. Now instead of calling the string `/bin/sh` directly, you create a byte sum to have the same result, but not clear text and therefore harder to track.

Other technique could be code encryption

## EXE code conversion

## Fake file type extension
