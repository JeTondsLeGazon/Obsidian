## Signature based
AV usually works based on signature, which may be unique to some extensions and/or programs. For example a program may look for a checksum composed of the file type + file length and if it does not match, we know the file has been compromised.
Idem for the first few bytes of the file you would expect

## Anomaly based
Anything out of the ordinary would be flagged. This can however lead to high number of false positives
